WindowsAzure.Storage.Replicate was designed to provide efficient and reliable replication of an entire Azure Blob Store. It uses server side copying (added in last 2012) to do the entire replication in the cloud. It is as simple as placing the connection strings for source and target and hitting replicate.

This program is currently in the experimental stage.
